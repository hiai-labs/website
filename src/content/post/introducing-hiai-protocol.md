At HiAI Labs, we share two core beliefs:

- Human intelligence is vital at every stage of AI development—from data annotation and model training to model evaluation and AI safety. AI development should be shaped and guided by human intelligence to better understand and benefit humans. 

- The ability to contribute to AI development and reap its benefits, both technological and economic, should be accessible to everyone. 
Our mission goes beyond philosophy; it’s a movement to redefine how AI benefits society. We aim to build a transparent and fair AI landscape, where participation in AI development is open to all, and financial rewards are equitably distributed to everyone. 

HiAI Labs ensures individuals—not just corporations—can fuel, develop, monetize and harness AI. 


### Our Vision

We envision an ecosystem where AI is truly of the humans, by the humans, and for the humans. On the AI part, we are building the Data Engine to provide a decentralized data labeling service, and the AI Platform to offer tools for knowledge base creation and agent development. Additionally, we plan to create an open forum dedicated to responsible AI and AI safety. On the blockchain front, we emphasize ownership, transparency, and fairness. By leveraging blockchain, we not only secure data but also foster an open environment where contributors are fairly rewarded for their input, and AI systems evolve transparently and accountably. HiAI Labs aims to build an ecosystem where data annotators, developers, and AI users collaborate seamlessly, aligned by transparent and fair incentives powered by blockchain. 

### Our Ecosystem 
Below, we delve into the three key components of our ecosystem separately.

- Data Engine.
The Data Engine is a decentralized data labeling service, allowing anyone to contribute data in training, finetuning and evaluating AI models and systems. By labeling data in exchange for rewards, contributors not only power the growth of cutting-edge AI systems but also have an opportunity to gain from their efforts in a tangible way. With blockchain securing each transaction, every participant gets fair compensation based on the quality and quantity of their contributions.

- AI Platform.
Building AI systems and AI agents has never been easier. With AI Platform, we enable everyone to develop custom, no-code AI systems and AI agents. Whether you’re an experienced developer or someone with no coding background, this platform allows you to harness the power of AI to build customized solutions for your domain of interest, all without needing to write a single line of code. For AI developers, this is the ultimate playground to experiment, create, and deploy innovative applications.

- Agora.
As AI becomes an integral part of society, responsible AI governance becomes a necessity. HiAI Labs provides Agora, a social forum where AI users, developers, and ethicists can converge to discuss, deliberate, and shape the future of artificial intelligence. Through Agora, we encourage open discussions on AI safety, transparency, ethical considerations, and ways to optimize AI's benefits for humanity. This platform serves as a voice for the community, ensuring that the AI technologies that shape our world are not only innovative but also responsible and inclusive.

### The Collaborative Economy
No longer are data scientists and machine learning engineers the sole architects of AI development. Everyone, from annotators contributing data labels to end-users building and using AI systems, plays a pivotal role in the evolution of these systems. The collaborative economy of AI is about harnessing collective intelligence to create more accurate, responsible, and valuable AI applications while ensuring that all participants are properly rewarded for their contributions. 

At HiAI Labs, we see blockchain and crypto as tools to level the playing field—ensuring that the value generated by AI is distributed equitably among all stakeholders in a seamless and transparent manner. Rather than working in isolation or being driven solely by speculation, community members of the HiAI ecosystem collaborate to create meaningful impact and share in fair rewards.

Our goal is not just to develop artificial intelligence but to build a sustainable AI ecosystem where human input drives innovation, fairness is embedded in design, and AI technologies work for people, not the other way around.

### Join Us on the Journey
The future of AI is collaborative, transparent, and, above all, human-centered. At HiAI Labs, we invite you to be a part of this transformative journey. Whether you’re a data annotator, a developer, an advocate, or an individual eager to contribute and thrive in the AI-driven world, there is a place for you in the HiAI ecosystem. Join us, and let’s fuel, develop, and harness AI in a way that benefits everyone!

### What Comes Next
Data Engine Beta Testing is coming up on Aptos Testnet. With tremendous support from the Aptos ecosystem, we are proud to build HiAI Protocol on Aptos!
